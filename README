ReplyWithHeaders causes the reply to behave like forwarding. I developed this long time
back on someones request. I don't use it much myself nor do I spend time developing it.
So if things break, I might not fix things quickly.

* Requirements:
Mail: Version 4.3 (1081)
Snow Leopard: 10.6.4

* Installation

1. Quit Mail.app
2. Save and unzip the attachment in ~/Library/Mail/Bundles (create the
directory if missing)
   Unzipping will return "ReplyWithHeaders.mailbundle" - copy this to
~/Library/Mail/Bundles
3. In the terminal:
> defaults write com.apple.mail EnableBundles -bool true
> defaults write com.apple.mail BundleCompatibilityVersion 4
4. Start Console.app (/Applications/Utilities)
5. In the search bar (top right corner of Console.app) type: Mail
   This will restrict your information to Mail.app messages
6. Restart Mail.app

In the console, if all goes well, you should see

ReplyWithHeaders: Oh its a wonderful life
